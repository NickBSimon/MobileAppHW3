# MobileAppHW3

For this assignment, we had to create an android app that satisfied a few requirements, with the biggest one being a weather feature. I learned how to implement a weather app using openweathermap.org's api by following a tutorial on youtube posted by "tech projects": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHgM_MQBQPg&list=RDCMUCO-vqQSN1N9unBqDHfL45TA&index=2
Otherwise, the rest of the work within the app is all mine.

The code for the app is within the master branch
